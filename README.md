I am a Computer Engineer with the [Science Data Processing](https://sed.gsfc.nasa.gov/etd/587) branch and the [Computational and Information Sciences and Technology Office](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/cisto/) (CISTO) [Data Science Group](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/cisto/istr) at the [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard). My research focuses on the development of software to support science research in the areas of Earth and Space observation, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing. My main interest is to shorten the gap between science, exploration, and artificial intelligence by means of hardware accelerated software applications, which include the development of GPU-backed data structures to support satellite data formats, deep learning applications to streamline annotation processes, and the portability of software to support open science initiatives via cloud and on-premises environments.

Software Organizations I Support:

* [NASA GSFC Data Science Group](https://github.com/nasa-nccs-hpda)
* [NASA ARSET](https://github.com/NASAARSET/ARSET_ML_Fundamentals)
